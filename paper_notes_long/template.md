## Scales spanned and how they are coupled

### Molecular / subcellular scale

- {Molecules, signals, intracellular states}
- {How they are represented}

### Cellular scale

- {Cell behaviors: division, migration, differentiation, death}
- {Decision rules and dependencies}

### Collective / tissue scale

- {Population-level structure or dynamics}
- {Morphology, patterning, regeneration, pathology}

### Key couplings

- Molecular → cellular: {How signals regulate cell behavior}
- Cellular → tissue: {How local rules generate global outcomes}
- Tissue → cellular (if applicable): {Feedback from geometry, stress, architecture}
