# Rat et al. 2025 — Telomere-driven senescence emerges from lineage–population desynchronization

## Short note

- **Paper:** Rat et al. 2025 — Telomere-driven senescence emerges from lineage–population desynchronization
- **Question:** We know telomere shortening triggers replicative senescence, but senescence onset is highly heterogeneous and asynchronous across cells. How do telomere-driven cell fate rules at the single-cell level scale up into emergent population-level senescence dynamics and selection effects?
- **Model:** Stochastic, agent-based population model with probabilistic state transitions
- **Imposed:** Telomeres shorten stochastically each division; cells transition between normal cycling, non-terminal arrest, terminal senescence arrest, and death according to probability laws that depend on the shortest telomere length (type A) or become telomere-independent after arrest priming (type B).
- **Varied:** Initial telomere length distributions; culture protocol parameters (e.g., saturation/dilution); telomere-independent mortality (to represent comorbid stress or cytotoxicity).
- **Measured:** Population growth curves over time; population telomere length mode/mean; distributions of cell “generational age”; fraction of senescent cells over time; changing composition of senescent cells (type A vs type B); telomere lengths at senescence onset.
- **Conclusion:** The model shows that replicative senescence has two distinct regimes: an early phase dominated by an almost deterministic shortest-telomere threshold, and a late phase where senescence becomes increasingly stochastic as population structure shifts. This work highlights a core multiscale point: population-level senescence is not a direct readout of average telomere shortening, but an emergent consequence of lineage heterogeneity, selection, and competition over time.
