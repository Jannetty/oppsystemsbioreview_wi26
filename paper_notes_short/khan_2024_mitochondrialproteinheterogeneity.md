# Khan et al. (2024) - Mitochondrial protein heterogeneity stems from the stochastic nature of co-translational protein targeting in cell senescence

## Short note

- **Paper**: Khan et al. (2024) - Mitochondrial protein heterogeneity stems from the stochastic nature of co-translational protein targeting in cell senescence
- **Question**: Mitochondria fragment in aging and senescence. Is fragmentation alone sufficient to generate mitochondrial dysfunction by producing compositional heterogeneity across fragments, preventing required protein interactions?
- **Model**: Stochastic model of co-translational protein delivery and protein mixing on a mitochondria represented as a network of discrete fragments.
- **Imposed**:  mRNAs can localize to the mitochondrial surface and deliver proteins during translation; translation and delivery are stochastic; mitochondria are represented as multiple fragments with limited exchange of contents between them.
- **Varied**: The fragmentation state (few large connected mitochondria vs many small isolated fragments), strength and persistence of co-translational targeting, degree of mixing between fragments (fusion) and removal of fragments (mitophagy).
- **Measured**: How unevenly proteins are distributed across fragments (protein stoichiometry heterogeneity), how effectively fusion/mixing, targeting inhibition, or mitophagy restores uniform composition.
- **Conclusion**: Senescence-associated mitochondrial dysfunction can emerge when mitochondria fragment into many isolated pieces, causing essential proteins to be delivered unevenly across fragments; the model predicts that fission–fusion dynamics help restore uniform composition by remixing mitochondrial contents. Mitophagy doesn't do a lot to restore mitochondrial function.
