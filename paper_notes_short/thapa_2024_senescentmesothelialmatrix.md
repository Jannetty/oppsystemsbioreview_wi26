# Thapa et al. (2024) — The senescent mesothelial matrix accentuates colonization by ovarian cancer cells

## Short note

- **Paper**: Thapa et al. (2024) — Senescent mesothelial ECM promotes ovarian cancer colonization
- **Question**:  We know chemotherapy can induce senescence in peritoneal mesothelial cells. Is senescence-induced ECM remodeling sufficient to increase ovarian cancer adhesion, migration, and mesothelial clearance during early metastatic colonization?
- **Model**: Multiscale Cellular Potts Model (compucell3d) linking cell–cell adhesion rules and senescent-cell extrusion logic to tissue-scale colonization dynamics (important note: senescent-cell extrusion causes local weak spots cancer can exploit).
- **Imposed**: Senescent vs non-senescent mesothelial cells with different effective adhesion to cancer cells, a rule for senescent-cell extrusion/clearance, cancer cell migration and proliferation within a mesothelial layer.
- **Varied**: Senescent vs non-senescent mesothelial cells with different effective adhesion to cancer cells, a rule for senescent-cell extrusion/clearance, cancer cell migration and proliferation within a mesothelial layer.
- **Measured**: Cancer cell adhesion/spreading and migration on mesothelial ECM, degree of cancer clustering, senescent mesothelial clearance/extrusion frequency, cancer area expansion within the monolayer.
- **Conclusion**: Metastatic colonization can emerge from disrupted cell–microenvironment coupling: senescence remodels mesothelial ECM to increase cancer adhesion and persistence, and when combined with extrusion dynamics this enables senescent-cell clearance and local invasion.
