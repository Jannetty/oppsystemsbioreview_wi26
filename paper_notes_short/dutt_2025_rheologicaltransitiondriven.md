# Dutt et al. 2025 — Rheological transition driven by matrix makes cancer spheroids resilient under confinement

## Short note

- **Paper**: Dutt et al. 2025 — Rheological transition driven by matrix makes cancer spheroids resilient under confinement
- **Question**: What physical and molecular features make ovarian cancer spheroids mechanically resilient during transit through narrow, confining peritoneal-like spaces?
- **Model**: Multiscale experimental + computational model (CPM, compucell3d) linking spheroid morphology and ECM to cell–cell adhesion and collective mechanical response under confinement.
- **Imposed**: Two spheroid architectures (moruloid = lumenless vs blastuloid = lumen-containing with ECM coat); constrictive microfluidic geometry; CPM/CompuCell3D model with tunable cell–cell adhesion and a deformable lumen-like core.
- **Varied**: Presence/absence of spheroid ECM coat (collagenase removal); E-cadherin expression (knockdown and overexpression); intercellular adhesion strength (via CPM contact energy); dynamic lumen deflation/inflation in simulations.
- **Measured**: Elastic modulus (AFM); deformation and recovery during/after channel transit (aspect ratio dynamics); entry time vs size scaling; internal cell rearrangements (PIV flow correlation); spheroid disintegration frequency.
- **Conclusion**: A basement-membrane–like ECM coat drives a transition from a labile, viscoplastic “moruloid” state to a resilient, elastic “blastuloid” state by supporting lumen maintenance and high intercellular adhesion (E-cadherin), enabling rapid shape recovery and reduced fracture under confinement. I.e. cancer spheroids become mechanically “tougher” because the group gains a protective outer matrix layer that reorganizes how cells stick together and respond to squeezing, making collective invasion possible in physically hostile environments.
