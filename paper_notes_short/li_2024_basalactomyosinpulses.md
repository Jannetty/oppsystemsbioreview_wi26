# Li et al. - Basal actomyosin pulses expand epithelium coordinating cell flattening and tissue elongation

## Short note

- **Paper:** Li et al. (2024) — Basal actomyosin pulses expand epithelium to coordinate cell flattening and tissue elongation
- **Question:** Actomyosin networks typically enhance contractility, yet in some systems actomyosin activity increases while cells expand. What mechanistic regime makes this apparent contradiction possible?
- **Model:** Modified vertex model of drosophila follicle epithelium expansion incorporating "expanding" basal actomyosin pulse mechanics.
- **Imposed:** rules for how internal sytoskeletal pulses (basal actomyosin), cell-edge protrusions, and cell-matrix attachments interact while the tissue is mechanically stretched by a growing oocyte. The key assumed rule is that stress fibers can actively pull to promote spreading, but cannot resist compression.
- **Varied:** Authors simulate perturbations that change:
  - actin-driven prodtrusive activity (Rac1)
  - actomyosin contractility (Rho1)
  - strength of cell-matrix adhesion (Paxillin overexpression or Talin knockdown)
  - rate of external tissue stretch imposed by oocyte growth
- **Measured:**
  - How waves of expansion propagate across epithelium
  - how much individual cells spread (increase in basal surface area)
  - How cell shapes change
  - How fast tissue collectively moves/elongates
  - whether timing of protrusions, contractile pulses, and adhesion strengthening stays coordinated
- **Conclusion:**
  - The model shows tissue-scale epithelial elongation can arise from local, subcellular force-generation dynamics when those dynamics are coordinated with adhesion and externally driven tissue deformation. I.e. morphogenesis depends on when and where contractile machinery is activated and coupled to adhesion.
