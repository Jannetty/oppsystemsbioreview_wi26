# Kaity & Lobo 2026 — Emergent stable tissue shapes from morphogen–growth feedback

## Short note

- **Paper**: Kaity & Lobo 2026 — Emergent stable tissue shapes from morphogen–growth feedback
- **Question**: When growth rules are imposed locally, what tissue-scale shapes can emerge from morphogen–growth feedback?
- **Model**: Off-lattice, cell-center tissue growth model coupled to diffusing morphogen reaction–diffusion dynamics.
- **Imposed**: Cells exert mechanical attraction/repulsion forces and undergo growth, division, or apoptosis based on local morphogen levels and local crowding stress. Morphogens diffuse between neighboring cells and are diluted by growth
- **Varied**: Morphogen production/diffusion/degradation parameters; crowding inhibition threshold; number/placement of organizer sources; and the wavelength of self-organizing Turing systems controlling growth.
- **Measured**: Emergent steady-state tissue size, shape class (circle, oval, triangular/star-like, filament), convergence time, and robustness of shape regeneration after perturbation.
- **Conclusion**: Stable tissue shapes can emerge only when morphogen patterning and tissue growth are coupled in a closed feedback loop, because the tissue geometry shapes morphogen patterns, and morphogen patterns reshape the tissue.
