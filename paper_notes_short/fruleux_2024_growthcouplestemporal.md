# Fruleux et al. 2024 — Growth couples temporal and spatial fluctuations during morphogenesis

## Short note

- **Paper**: Fruleux et al. 2024 — Growth couples temporal and spatial fluctuations during morphogenesis
- **Question**: How can tissues develop reproducible organ shapes when growth is noisy, and what determines whether growth variability remains local or becomes long-range across the organ?
- **Model**: Minimal theoretical model linking tissue growth (expansion) to the emergence of long-range spatial correlations in any temporally persistent tissue property.
- **Imposed**: A tissue property (e.g., growth rate) is (i) carried along by tissue expansion, (ii) relaxes toward a baseline over a characteristic “memory time,” and (iii) is continuously perturbed by random noise
- **Varied**: Tissue growth rate; the persistence (“memory”) timescale of fluctuations; and (in experiments) genotype and growth conditions affecting mechanical feedback strength
- **Measured**: Spatial correlation structure of growth fluctuations (power-law / long-range correlations); temporal persistence of growth fluctuations; and whether different datasets collapse onto a single predicted relationship.
- **Conclusion**: Tissue growth itself can convert temporally persistent local variability into long-range spatial correlations (“fluctuation stretching”), implying that robustness of organ shape depends not only on the amplitude of noise but on how long fluctuations persist in time.
