# Miller et al. 2025 — Immune dynamics during early endometriosis lesion onset

## Short note

- **Paper**: Miller et al. 2025 — Immune dynamics during early endometriosis lesion onset
- **Question**: Can early endometriosis lesion onset be explained by increased retrograde influx of endometrial cells alone, or does disease require immune dysfunction—and if so, is the key defect impaired detection or impaired clearance?
- **Model**: Compartmental ODE model of innate immune–endometrial cell interactions in peritoneal fluid during early lesion establishment (arguibly not spatial).
- **Imposed**: Cyclic retrograde influx of endometrial cells; macrophage activation into M1/M2-like states; NK activation; immune-mediated clearance of ectopic endometrial cells; lesion establishment via attachment + proliferation upregulated by M2-like macrophages.
- **Varied**: Retrograde influx level; macrophage detection rate of ectopic endometrial cells; immune clearance (cytotoxicity) rate.
- **Measured**: End-of-cycle attached endometrial cell burden (disease proxy); macrophage activation profiles; NK activation; bifurcation structure and presence of bistability/hysteresis.
- **Conclusion**: Increased endometrial cell influx can explain chronic inflammation signatures but is not sufficient for disease; reduced immune clearance is the dominant driver of lesion onset, and the model predicts a bistable/hysteretic transition where restoring immune function after onset requires disproportionately large recovery.
