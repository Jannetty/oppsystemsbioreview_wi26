# Gill et a. 2024 - Divergent buckling patterns in the chick gut

## Short note

- **Paper**: Gill et a. 2024 - Divergent buckling patterns in the chick gut
- **Question**: How can distinct segment-specific gut morphologies emerge from a common tubular primordium?
- **Model**: Continuum mechanical model of tissue growth and differential elastic properties, coupled to minimal theory and simulations of differential growth.
- **Imposed**: Tissue-scale growth laws, geometry, mechanical moduli/elastic properties along the gut axis; differential growth rates across regions of the tube.
- **Varied**: Regional growth rates, tissue stiffness/moduli, geometry parameters (radius, wall thickness)… to explore how different mechanical regimes produce patterns.
- **Measured**: Emergent buckling patterns (wrinkles, folds, creases, period-doubling), spatial wavelength and morphology; comparison to observed segment-specific gut shapes.
- **Conclusion**: Organ-scale morphological diversity can arise from mechanical and geometric differences imposed at the tissue scale, showing that differential growth and material properties are sufficient to produce stereotyped patterns of buckling and form across gut segments.
