# Berkemeier & Page 2023 — Coupling dynamics of 2D Notch–Delta signaling

## Short note

- **Paper:** Berkemeier & Page 2023 — Coupling dynamics of 2D Notch–Delta signaling
- **Question:** How does the spatial coupling structure of Notch–Delta signaling (nearest-neighbor vs long-range protrusions) control which tissue-scale patterns are stable in 2D?
- **Model:** 2D lattice ODE model of Notch–Delta lateral inhibition with tunable long-range coupling.
- **Imposed:** Each cell contains Notch and Delta variables with local lateral inhibition dynamics, and receives input from other cells through a defined coupling rule (neighbors and/or protrusion-reached cells).
- **Varied:** The relative strength of protrusion-based vs juxtacrine signaling (ε), and the assumptions about protrusion connectivity (e.g., distance decay, stochasticity).
- **Measured:** Which spatial patterns emerge and persist in 2D (e.g., spacing/sparsity, symmetry breaking, stability), and where analytical predictions succeed or fail.
- **Conclusion:** Tissue-scale pattern selection depends strongly on the geometry and range of cell–cell coupling in 2D, showing that the same intracellular Notch–Delta rules can yield qualitatively different developmental outcomes depending on how cells are connected in space.
