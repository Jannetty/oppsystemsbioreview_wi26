# Venturini & Sáez 2023 — A multiscale clutch model for adhesion complex mechanics

## Short note

- **Paper**: Venturini & Sáez (2023) — Multiscale clutch model for adhesion mechanics
- **Question**: Which molecular “design features” of adhesion complexes are sufficient to control cell-scale traction force generation?
- **Model**: Multiscale mechanochemical clutch model linking adhesion-complex dynamics to cell-scale mechanics.
- **Imposed**: Force-dependent binding/unbinding and reinforcement dynamics for integrin–talin–actin coupling, including talin unfolding and actin retrograde flow.
- **Varied**: Integrin binding kinetics/force–lifetime behavior; extracellular matrix stiffness; ligand binding-site density/spacing.
- **Measured**: Cell-scale traction force/stress; actin retrograde flow; adhesion engagement/stability.
- **Conclusion**: Cell-scale mechanical coordination can emerge from explicitly specified subcellular force-transmission rules, showing how changing molecular-scale assumptions propagates upward to alter emergent cellular mechanics.
