# De Santis et al. 2025 — Mechanochemical symmetry breaking in human gastruloids

## Short note

- **Paper**: De Santis et al. 2025 — Crosstalk between tissue mechanics and BMP4 signaling regulates symmetry breaking in human gastrula models
- **Question**: How do biochemical morphogen signals and tissue mechanics jointly regulate early embryonic symmetry breaking in human stem-cell–based gastrulation models?
- **Model**: Reaction-diffusion PDEs on changing tissue geometry, integrates tissue-scale mechanical state and BMP4 morphogen dynamics to explain how mechanical cues influence pattern formation during gastrulation
- **Imposed**: Tissue-scale mechanical context (tension/geometry), BMP4 signaling kinetics (binding, induction), and mechanosensitive modulation via YAP1–WNT–NODAL circuitry; light-inducible BMP4 activation defines spatial input.
- **Varied**: Spatial pattern of BMP4 induction via optogenetics; mechanical constraints/tension states (e.g., geometry, confinement); feedback strength between mechanics and downstream signaling.
- **Measured**: Emergent symmetry breaking and germ-layer patterning (SMAD1–5 phosphorylation, mesoderm induction), the influence of mechanics on WNT/NODAL induction, and spatial organization of cell fates in gastruloid models.
- **Conclusion**: The interplay between tissue mechanics and morphogen signaling is necessary for robust symmetry breaking in human gastrulation models, demonstrating that mechanical state can modulate biochemical patterning, shaping tissue-scale organization during early development.
