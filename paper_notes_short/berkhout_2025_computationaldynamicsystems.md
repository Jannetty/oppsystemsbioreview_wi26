# Berkhout et a. 2025 A computational dynamic systems model for in silico prediction of neural tube closure defects

## Short note

- **Paper**: Berkhout et a. 2025 A computational dynamic systems model for in silico prediction of neural tube closure defects
- **Question**: Which gene-regulatory and biomechanical disruptions are sufficient to produce specific neural tube closure defect phenotypes? Can an ABM predict defect risk from those disruptions?
- **Model**: CPM (compucell3D) of mammalian neural tube closure with embedded gene regulatory network
- **Imposed**: 2D initial geometry with multiple embryonic cell types, rules dictating how morphogen gradients impact cell behaviors (apical constriction, hinge point formation, neural crest delamination, tissue pushing forces)
- **Varied**: Synthetic gene perturbations of key regulatory genes controlling cell responses to morphogen gradients (floor plate formation, dorsolateral hinge point formation, neural crest delamination)
- **Measured**: Whether neural tube closes normally or produces defects, if defects occur what types of defects (open vs closed vs midline fusion phenotypes)
- **Conclusion**: Neural tube defects can emerge from molecular perturbations. Model itself can be used as in silico testbed for predicting defect probability and phenotype in conditions where genetic regulatory relationships are well known.
