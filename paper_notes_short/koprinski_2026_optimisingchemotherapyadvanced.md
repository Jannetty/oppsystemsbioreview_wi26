# Koprinski et al. 2026  - Optimising Chemotherapy for Advanced High-Grade Serous Ovarian Cancer via Delay-Differential Equations

## Short note

- **Paper**: Koprinski et al. 2026  - Optimising Chemotherapy for Advanced High-Grade Serous Ovarian Cancer via Delay-Differential Equations
- **Question**: How can we use a mechanistic model of tumour–immune dynamics to design chemotherapy schedules that maintain tumour control while reducing patient toxicity?
- **Model**: Two-compartment immunobiological model (tumour site + tumour-draining lymph node) formulated as delay-differential equations (DDEs) (also arguibly not spatial)
- **Imposed**: Tumour growth and immune interactions spanning dendritic-cell maturation, T-cell priming/proliferation, and cytokine dynamics; chemotherapy effects act through the system and include explicit biological time delays.
- **Varied**: Chemotherapy dosing strategies (dose intensity vs dosing frequency) and schedules including rest weeks to allow recovery from toxicity.
- **Measured**: Model-predicted tumour control (“efficacy”), treatment-associated toxicity, and a combined notion of treatment efficiency balancing both.
- **Conclusion**: The model predicts that lower, more frequent dosing can achieve comparable tumour control to standard regimens while reducing toxicity, and that including rest periods may improve recovery and overall treatment efficiency.
