# Johnson et al. 2025 — Stream confinement in cranial neural crest

## Short note

- **Paper**: Johnson et al. 2025 — Stream confinement in cranial neural crest
- **Question**: Can cranial neural crest cell (CNCC) streams self-confine without imposing artificial boundaries, and which molecular cues are sufficient to produce confinement, coherence, and controlled exchange?
- **Model**: Multi-scale ABM of extracellular signaling fields (PDEs) and migrating cells (ABM) in developing cranial tissue
- **Imposed**: Rules linking local field values to cell motility/adhesion and rules for how cells reshape fields
- **Varied**: Spatial expression patterns and strengths of Trail/Colec12/Dan; presence/absence of Colec12 chemotaxis; VEGF-related leader–follower settings; geometry for single vs dual streams.
- **Measured**: Distribution and paths of migrating cells
- **Conclusion**: Tissue-scale stream confinement and coherence can emerge from explicitly specified cell–signal interaction rules.
